The deck of pain is a workout game originated in prison in which you draw a card from the deck and depending on the suit of the card and the number in it you do a specific exercise according to the suit and you do a specific amount/time according to the number. For example, if you pull a 2 of spades, you do 2 sit-ups. On the contrary, if you pull an ace of spades you do the most sit-ups you can. Aces means the most amount/time you can do an exercise. Jack, Queen and Kings are 10.
